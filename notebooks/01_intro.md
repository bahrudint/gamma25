# üìò Notebook 1 ‚Äî Exploring Raw Electron Tracks

**Goal**: Get familiar with electron track data: structure, scale, and visual appearance  
**Scope**: Load raw tracks, visualize them in 3D, explore how energy and topology relate

---

## üß† Background

Each track represents an electron propagating through a Time Projection Chamber (TPC), simulated in liquid argon.  
We capture:
- 3D charge deposition (`r`)
- Charge intensity at each point (`num_e`)
- Ground truth properties from associated metadata files

This notebook helps you explore the raw data and build an intuition for track shapes and behavior.

## üìÇ Data Structure

```

example_data/
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ electrons/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ E0000100/   ‚Üê 100 keV
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ E0001000/   ‚Üê 1 MeV
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ E0050000/   ‚Üê 5 MeV
...

````

Each folder contains:
- `.npz` files: track data
- `.pickle` files: truth metadata (origin, direction, interaction type)

---

## üß∞ Setup and Imports

```python
import os
import glob
import pickle
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from Gampy.tools import tracks_tools
````

---

## üì¶ Load a Track

**First**: Go and explore the file structure and the naming conventions. Each E00###### has 10 .npz and .pickle files
.npz files contain the raw track information (3D positions and charge)
.pickle files contain "Truth" information i.e. what created them, where was the first interaction, what angle it came from etc. 

```python
# Choose one electron track file
folder = 'example_data/electrons/E0001000'
track_file = glob.glob(os.path.join(folder, 'TrackE*.npz'))[0]

# Extract energy from filename (in keV)
energy = int(track_file.split("TrackE")[1].split("_")[0])

# Initialize the Track object (this will load the npz and pickle file) 
track = tracks_tools.Tracks(track_file.rstrip('.npz'))
```

At this point it is good to explore the attributes of the Track object.  
```python
print(dict(track.__dict__).keys())
```
For each attribute, explore the keys it has and gat familiar with their meaning, for example:
```python
print(track.truth.keys())
```
Documentation about the Track class can be found here:

```

## üîé Examine Track Properties

```python
truth = track.truth
positions = track.raw['r'].T                # shape: (N, 3)
charges = track.raw['num_e']                # shape: (N,)

print(f"Track energy:           {energy / 1000:.1f} MeV")
print(f"Number of points:       {len(positions)}")
print(f"Total deposited charge: {charges.sum():.1f} e‚Åª")

# Optionally examine truth
print(f"True origin:            {truth['origin']}")
print(f"Initial direction:      {truth['initial_direction']}")
```

---

## üé® Visualize the Track in 3D

```python
fig = plt.figure(figsize=(8, 6))
ax = fig.add_subplot(111, projection='3d')

sc = ax.scatter(positions[:, 0], positions[:, 1], positions[:, 2],
                c=charges, cmap='plasma', s=2, alpha=0.8)

ax.set_title(f"{energy / 1000:.1f} MeV Electron Track ‚Äî Raw")
ax.set_xlabel("X (m)")
ax.set_ylabel("Y (m)")
ax.set_zlabel("Z (m)")

plt.colorbar(sc, label="Charge (e‚Åª)")
plt.tight_layout()
plt.show()
```

---

## üß† Challenge 1 ‚Äî Compare Charge

```python
total_charge_data = charges.sum()
total_charge_truth = truth['num_electrons']

print(f"Track-integrated charge: {total_charge_data:.1f} e‚Åª")
print(f"Truth label charge:      {total_charge_truth:.1f} e‚Åª")
```

* Are the values close? Why might there be a discrepancy?

---

## üß† Challenge 2 ‚Äî Energy Scaling

**Visualize tracks at different energies to compare spread and structure.**

```python
energies = [100, 1000, 5000]  # keV
folders = [f"example_data/electrons/E{e:07d}" for e in energies]
files = [glob.glob(os.path.join(folder, 'TrackE*.npz'))[0] for folder in folders]

fig = plt.figure(figsize=(16, 5))

for i, file in enumerate(files):
    tr = tracks_tools.Tracks(file.rstrip('.npz'))
    pos = tr.raw['r'].T
    ch = tr.raw['num_e']

    ax = fig.add_subplot(1, 3, i + 1, projection='3d')
    ax.scatter(pos[:, 0], pos[:, 1], pos[:, 2], c=ch, cmap='inferno', s=1)
    ax.set_title(f"{energies[i] / 1000:.1f} MeV")
    ax.set_xlabel("X"); ax.set_ylabel("Y"); ax.set_zlabel("Z")
    ax.grid(True)

plt.suptitle("Raw Electron Tracks at Different Energies", fontsize=14)
plt.tight_layout()
plt.show()
```

* How does the spatial extent change?
* Do higher energies result in longer or more branched tracks?

---

## üß† Challenge 3 ‚Äî Track Extent

**Compute the physical size of the track.**

```python
extent = positions.max(axis=0) - positions.min(axis=0)
print(f"Track extent (X, Y, Z): {extent} meters")
```

* Which direction has the most spread?
* Why is that relevant for direction-finding tasks?

---

## ‚úÖ Summary

You have:

* Loaded and explored real simulated tracks from electron interactions
* Visualized 3D charge distributions
* Observed energy-dependent changes in track topology

You now have a basic grasp of:

* What an electron track looks like
* How charge is spatially deposited
* What truth data accompanies each track
