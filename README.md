# Electron Track Analysis 2026 — GammaTPC ML Study

Welcome to the central hub for our collaborative effort to study **electron tracks above 100 keV** in the **GammaTPC/GAMPix detector** using analytical methods and machine learning techniques.

This work builds on the concepts and detector technology described in:
- [GammaTPC Concept Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14841) _skim this paper, look at images_
- [Probabilistic Deep Learning for Electron Tracks in LArTPC](https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.07805) _this one is important and it will be the basis of our study_
- [GAMPix Readout System](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.00902) _this one explains track properties and our readout methods_

## 🔍 Purpose

This repository supports a focused research study in **Summer–Fall 2025**
Our aim is to improve reconstruction and understanding of **electron track head location** and **initial direction**, especially in the **Compton** and **Pair Production** regimes (> 0.1 MeV).

### Primary Objectives

- ✅ Machine Learning models for:
  - Head location (start of track)
  - Initial direction vector
- ✅ Separate studies for:
  - **Compton regime**
  - **Pair Production regime**

These will lead to the:
- ✅ Angular resolution and sensitivity estimation of GammaTPC
- ✅ 2-3 Papers 

### Bonus Explorations
- Polarization sensitivity
- Effects of drift length, readout pitch, and energy
- Scattering path reconstruction, energy estimation from that
- Reconstruction optimization (CKD, permutation handling)
